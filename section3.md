## Getting Started With GitHub
1. Sign into GitHub and click new repository
2. Give your repository a name (and a README and gitignore if you want)
3. Create your repository

## Forking vs. Cloning
Forking is a feature on GitHub that allows a user to take a copy of someone else's repository and use it for their own personal use with the ability to make pull requests. Cloning is a Git concept extremely similar to forking, with the main difference being that cloning allows a person to make an unconnected copy of a repository to place in a directory of their choosing.
